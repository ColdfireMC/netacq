LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell core_inst/i2cmaster4_inst/fifo_comp/FIFO_SYNC_MACRO_inst/bl.fifo_36_inst_bl_1.fifo_36_bl_1_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) core_inst/i2cmaster4_inst/fifo_comp/FIFO_SYNC_MACRO_inst/bl.fifo_36_inst_bl_1.fifo_36_bl_1/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell sync_reset_inst/m_rst_sync1_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) core_inst/eth_mac_inst/rx_fifo/fifo_inst/m_rst_sync1_reg_reg/PRE,

core_inst/eth_mac_inst/rx_fifo/fifo_inst/s_rst_sync3_reg_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell sync_reset_inst/m_rst_sync2_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) core_inst/eth_mac_inst/tx_fifo/fifo_inst/m_rst_sync1_reg_reg/PRE,

Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#1 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance core_inst/udp_complete_inst/ip_complete_inst/arp_inst/arp_cache_inst/valid_mem_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#2 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance core_inst/udp_complete_inst/ip_complete_inst/arp_inst/arp_cache_inst/valid_mem_reg_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#3 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance core_inst/udp_complete_inst/ip_complete_inst/arp_inst/arp_cache_inst/valid_mem_reg_256_383_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#4 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance core_inst/udp_complete_inst/ip_complete_inst/arp_inst/arp_cache_inst/valid_mem_reg_384_511_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-16#1 Warning
Address collision  
Block RAM core_inst/udp_complete_inst/ip_complete_inst/arp_inst/arp_cache_inst/ip_addr_mem_reg may get memory collision error if read and write address collide. Use of address collision resolution circuitry is recommended.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-11#1 Warning
Inappropriate max delay with datapath only option  
A max delay constraint with -datapath_only has been applied between core_inst/eth_mac_inst/eth_mac_1g_rgmii_inst/rgmii_phy_if_inst/rgmii_tx_clk_1_reg/C and core_inst/eth_mac_inst/eth_mac_1g_rgmii_inst/rgmii_phy_if_inst/clk_oddr_inst/oddr[0].oddr_inst/D1. The startpoint(s) and endpoint(s) either belong to the same clock domain or belong to two clock domains that can safely be timed together (without valid synchronizer). It is only recommended to use the -datapath_only option on paths between clocks that do not have a known phase relationship. This DRC is waived when a synchronizer is found on the path endpoint
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-11#2 Warning
Inappropriate max delay with datapath only option  
A max delay constraint with -datapath_only has been applied between core_inst/eth_mac_inst/eth_mac_1g_rgmii_inst/rgmii_phy_if_inst/rgmii_tx_clk_2_reg/C and core_inst/eth_mac_inst/eth_mac_1g_rgmii_inst/rgmii_phy_if_inst/clk_oddr_inst/oddr[0].oddr_inst/D2. The startpoint(s) and endpoint(s) either belong to the same clock domain or belong to two clock domains that can safely be timed together (without valid synchronizer). It is only recommended to use the -datapath_only option on paths between clocks that do not have a known phase relationship. This DRC is waived when a synchronizer is found on the path endpoint
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on phy_rx_ctl relative to clock(s) phy_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on phy_rxd[0] relative to clock(s) phy_rx_clk

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on phy_rxd[1] relative to clock(s) phy_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on phy_rxd[2] relative to clock(s) phy_rx_clk

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on phy_rxd[3] relative to clock(s) phy_rx_clk
Related violations: <none>
